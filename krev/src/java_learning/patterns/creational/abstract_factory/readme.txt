query: give example of Abstract Factory Pattern using Java

When to Use the Abstract Factory Pattern:
When you need to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
When you want to ensure that the created objects are compatible with each other.
When the system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.

This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you have multiple product families
(like different UI toolkits for different operating systems) and want to ensure that the client code works seamlessly with any family.
