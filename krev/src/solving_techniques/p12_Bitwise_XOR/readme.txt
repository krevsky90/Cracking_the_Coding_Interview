XOR is a logical bitwise operator that returns 0 (false) if both bits are the same and returns 1 (true) otherwise.
In other words, it only returns 1 if exactly one bit is set to 1 out of the two bits in comparison.
It is surprising to know the approaches that the XOR operator enables us to solve certain problems.

Legend:
a^b - means a XOR b

Properties:

1) a^a = 0
2) IF a1^a2^..^an = a AND a1^a2^..^an-1 = b THEN b^an = a
3) a^1s = ~a
