4. Merge Intervals
Usage: This technique is used to deal with overlapping intervals.
Given two intervals (?a? and ?b?), there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other:

1) 'a' and 'b' do not overlap (a < b)
2) 'a' and 'b' overlap, 'b' ends after 'a'
3) 'a' completely overlaps 'b'
4) 'a' and 'b' overlap, 'a' ends after 'b'
5) 'b' completely overlaps 'a'
6) 'a' and 'b' do not overlap (b < a)

KREVSKY:
in practice I would highlight the following cases:
1) 'a' and 'b' do not overlap (a < b)
2) 'a' and 'b' overlap, 'b' ends after 'a'
3) 'a' completely overlaps 'b'
