Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that uses brute-force approach to solve a problem.

Brute-force approach states that for any problem,
we should try out all possible solutions and pick up those solutions that satisfy the problem constraints.

In backtracking, we build a solution incrementally and follow the approach that if the current solution can?t lead to a valid solution,
 abandon it and backtrack (or go back) to try another solution.
 Because of this, recursion becomes a suitable technique for solving backtracking problems.

Dynamic Programming (DP) uses a similar approach where we try out all possible solutions (using Memoization)
 to pick up the most optimized solution. DP is used to solve optimization problems; backtracking,
 on the other hand, is mostly used when multiple valid solutions are possible for a problem.
