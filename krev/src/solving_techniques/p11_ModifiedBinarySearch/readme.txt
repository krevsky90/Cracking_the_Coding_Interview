Whenever we are given a sorted Array or LinkedList or Matrix,
and we are asked to find a certain element, the best algorithm we can use is the Binary Search.

NOTE: be careful with left = mid OR mid + 1!
    Consider the case for sub-array that has (right - left) = 1, because mid = left in this case => we need to add +1
