Theory:
A Trie, short for retrieval, is a specialized tree-based data structure primarily used for efficient storing, searching, and retrieval of strings over a given alphabet.
It excels in scenarios where a large collection of strings needs to be managed and pattern-matching operations need to be performed with optimal efficiency.
