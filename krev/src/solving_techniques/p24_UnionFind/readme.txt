Union Find, also known as Disjoint Set Union (DSU),
is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets (meaning no set overlaps with another).
It provides two primary operations:
- find, which determines which subset a particular element is in,
- and union, which merges two subsets into a single subset.

This pattern is particularly useful for problems where we need to find whether 2 elements belong to the same group
or need to solve connectivity-related problems in a graph or tree.
