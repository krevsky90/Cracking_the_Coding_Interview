/**
 * 791. Custom Sort String (medium)
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string
 *
 * #Company: Amazon Facebook Uber
 *
 * You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.
 * Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted.
 * More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.
 * Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"
 * Output: "cbad"
 * Explanation: "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".
 * Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: order = "bcafg", s = "abcd"
 * Output: "bcad"
 * Explanation: The characters "b", "c", and "a" from order dictate the order for the characters in s.
 * The character "d" in s does not appear in order, so its position is flexible.
 * Following the order of appearance in order, "b", "c", and "a" from s should be arranged as "b", "c", "a". "d" can be placed at any position since it's not in order.
 * The output "bcad" correctly follows this rule. Other arrangements like "dbca" or "bcda" would also be valid, as long as "b", "c", "a" maintain their order.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= order.length <= 26
 * 1 <= s.length <= 200
 * order and s consist of lowercase English letters.
 * All the characters of order are unique
