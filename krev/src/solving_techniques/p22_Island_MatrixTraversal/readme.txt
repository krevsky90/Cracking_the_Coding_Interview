Many coding interview problems involve traversing 2D arrays (aka matrix or grid).
The Island pattern describes all the efficient ways to traverse a matrix.
This pattern will go through many problems to explain matrix traversal
using Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) approaches and their variants.

Theory:
see 3 solutions of NumberOfIslands:
1) DFS + mark visited cells by changing the original matrix
2) BFS (queue that store unvisited cells) + mark visited cells by changing the original matrix
3) BFS (...) + keep separate matrix to mark a cell visited

Sequence of problems:
1) Number of Islands (easy) - done
2) Biggest Island (easy) - done
3) Flood Fill (easy) - done
4) Number of Closed Islands (easy) - todo
5) Problem Challenge 1 (easy) - todo
6) Problem Challenge 2 (medium) - todo
7) Problem Challenge 3 (medium) - todo
