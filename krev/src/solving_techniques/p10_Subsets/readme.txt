A huge number of coding interview problems involve dealing with Permutations and Combinations of a given set of elements.
This pattern describes an efficient Breadth First Search (BFS) approach to handle all these problems.

Combinatorics
    Permutations (order is significant)
        with repetitions
        without repetitions
    Subsets (combinations) - order is NOT significant
        with repetitions
        without repetitions



Sequence of problems:
1) Subsets (easy) - done
2) Subsets With Duplicates (easy/medium) - done
3) Permutations (medium) - todo
4) String Permutations by changing case (medium) - todo
5) Balanced Parentheses (hard) - todo
6) Unique Generalized Abbreviations (hard) - todo
7) Problem Challenge 1: Evaluate Expression (hard) - todo
8) Problem Challenge 2: Structurally Unique Binary Search Trees (hard) - todo
9) Problem Challenge 3: Count of Structurally Unique Binary Search Trees (hard) - todo
