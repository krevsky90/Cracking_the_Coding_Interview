Theory:
Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order of operation.
This order can either be Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In Last Out (FILO).
Imagine you have a pile of books that you plan to read.
You keep adding books to the top of the pile.
When you're ready to start reading, you take a book from the top of the pile.
The last book you added to the pile is the first one you read.
That's LIFO - the principle that stack data structures operate on.

Techniques:
1) Monotonic stack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq_ObZwTY_Q
    applicable to 'Find next greater element' (use decreasing stack)
