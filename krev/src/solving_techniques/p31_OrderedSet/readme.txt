Theory:
Ordered Set is an extension of the Set data structure.
An Ordered Set is a powerful data structure that blends the uniqueness of a set with the ordered sequence of a list.
Unlike traditional sets, where the elements are unsorted, an ordered set maintains the sequence of its elements,
making it a versatile choice for many applications.
