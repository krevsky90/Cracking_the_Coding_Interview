Theory:
A Greedy algorithm is used to solve problems in which the best choice is made at each step,
    and it finds a solution in a minimal step.
This approach assumes that choosing a local optimum at each stage will lead to the determination of a global optimum.
It's like making the most beneficial decision at every crossroad, hoping it leads to the ultimate destination efficiently.
