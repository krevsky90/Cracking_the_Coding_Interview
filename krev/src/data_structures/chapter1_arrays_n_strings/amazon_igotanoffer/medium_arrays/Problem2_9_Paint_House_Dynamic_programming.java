 * Description
 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green.
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different.
 * You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
 * <p>
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix.
 * For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red;
 * costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so onâ€¦
 * Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 * <p>
 * All costs are positive integers.
 * <p>
 * Example
 * Given costs = [[14,2,11],[11,14,5],[14,3,10]] return 10
 * <p>
 * house 0 is blue, house 1 is green, house 2 is blue, 2 + 5 + 3 = 10
