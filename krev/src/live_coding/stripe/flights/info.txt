Q1:
Given an input string: "UK:US:FedEx:4,UK:FR:Jet1:2,US:UK:RyanAir:8,CA:UK:CanadaAir:8"
Which represents flights between destinations in the format: "Source:Destination:Airline:Cost,..."
Write a function which will take a Source and Destination and output the cost.

NOTE!! I'M SURE THIS FOLLOW-UP CAN BE SKIPPED AND WE CAN JUST IMPLEMENT BFS SKIPPING DFS!
Follow-up 1:
Write a function which will take an Input String, Source and Destination that have no direct connecting flight,
and output a route that you can take to reach the destination.
The output should be in the format: return {'route': 'US -> UK -> FR', 'method': 'RyanAir -> Jet1', 'cost': 10}

My Follow-up 2:
Write a function which will take an Input String, Source and Destination that have no direct connecting flight,
and output the shortest (amount of flights) route that you can take to reach the destination.

My Follow-up 3:
Write a function which will take an Input String, Source and Destination that have no direct connecting flight,
and output the cheapest (total cost of flights) route that you can take to reach the destination.
