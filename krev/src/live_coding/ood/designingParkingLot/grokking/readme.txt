Problem definition
  A parking lot is a designated area for parking vehicles and is a feature found in almost all popular venues such as shopping malls, sports stadiums, offices, etc.
  In a parking lot, there are a fixed number of parking spots available for different types of vehicles.
  Each of these spots is charged according to the time the vehicle has been parked in the parking lot.
  The parking time is tracked with a parking ticket issued to the vehicle at the entrance of the parking lot.
  Once the vehicle is ready to exit, it can either pay at the automated exit panel or to the parking agent at the exit using a card or cash payment method.

Итого:
1) не понимаю, как вплести ParkingAgent в Exit. в ParkingAgent дергать метод Exit-а ?
2) не тестил содержимое ParkingTicket-a
